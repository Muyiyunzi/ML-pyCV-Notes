# Machine Learning & python Computer Vision-Notes
notes of the book 'Machine Learning', AU: Zhou Zhihua
<br>& notes of the book 'python Computer Vision', AU: Jan Erik Solem

Here I'll be merging the notes of these two books. Using jupyter notebook, I'd also be merging codes & notes in a .ipynb file.

2020/6/11 Uploaded Week 1 Notes and images (image/W1/)

2020/6/13 Branched twice to test how .md works on Github

2020/6/19 Uploaded Week 2 Notes and images (iamge/W2/) and some other packages (sift.exe & vl.dll for SIFT)

2020/6/30 Rearrange folders and files, and uploaded week 3 notes and slides. Still don't know how to delete a folder...it seems that using git instructions would be easier, so leave it be for a while:)

2020/8/6 too many image files for Week 8, so I just uploaded codes and part of the image. If you want to download the full package, just use the BaiduYunDiskNet link here: 链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1S6QWwfFmL-ZInbNU5cwHTg 提取码：asdf
